glasses, and ear-buds offer lightweight, non-invasive, and ecologically valid
means to monitor human activity, affective state, and social behavior. With the
rise of commercially deployed devices and new wearable foundation models,
opportunities for scalable human behavior analysis continue to grow. However,
challenges such as <strong>personalized modeling, on-device integration,</strong> or
<strong>multimodal fusion</strong> prevail, limiting in-the-wild deployment of wearable devices.</p><p>Recent research has focused on advancing both modeling and sensing
capabilities of wearable systems. In particular, the emergence of wearable
foundation models enables researchers to work with expressive representations
that scale to large populations and capture complex signals. On the other hand,
researchers are developing increasingly sophisticated devices to capture
physiological signals non-invasively, i.e., remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
which can measure heart rate from videos of the face. These advances have
enabled the widespread adoption of commercial wearables such as
smartwatches, allowing individuals to monitor their sleep, mood, or health. They
are also supporting a variety of applications, from tracking affective states and
social behaviors, to support human-robot interaction, mobile health, and
behavioral research in both laboratory and real-world contexts.</p><p>However, significant challenges remain in both computational modeling and
sensor design. Human behavior is inherently complex, context-dependent, and
individual, making its analysis through wearable sensing particularly challenging.
Even in controlled environments where task complexity is limited, learning
personalized and/or generalized models remains difficult due to the high
variability across individuals and our incomplete understanding of the underlying
physiological mechanisms. This challenge is directly related to the multimodal
nature of human behaviors, with different physiological or movement signals
conveying distinct yet complementary information. Finally, as wearables are
designed to monitor people in real-world, uncontrolled settings, they bring
additional concerns related to privacy, ethical use, and data integrity.</p><p>The 1st Workshop on Behavioral and Emotion Analysis through wearable Technology (BEAT) aims to foster collaboration between ML researchers from various backgrounds (Gesture & Face Analysis, Affective Computing, HRI), as well as researchers in biomedical engineering. The main focus is on lightweight wearable movement and physiological sensors for computational human behavior analysis. While contributions are expected to be centered on real-world and ecologically valid settings, we also welcome controlled laboratory studies that introduce novel sensing approaches, benchmark datasets, or innovative applications.</p><p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Machine Learning and computational models for movement and physiological wearables</li><li>Resource efficient and lightweight models</li><li>Multimodal fusion and synchronization strategies</li><li>Methods for irregularly sampled or missing data</li><li>Individual differences, personalization and context-awareness</li><li>Ethical and privacy-preserving AI in wearable systems</li><li>Novel wearables and applications</li><li>Experimental methods for validation of wearable systems</li><li>Lab-controlled experiments and In-the-wild deployment</li><li>Datasets and Benchmarks</li><li>Responsible data management and user consent</li><li>Applications in Affective Computing / Mobile Health / Action Recognition / Social Interaction / HRI</li></ul></section></article><div class='post-after light'></div></div><div class='post-holder dark'><article id=keynotes class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Keynotes</h2></header><section class=post-content><figure class=left><img src=/images/aaqib.webp alt="Aaqib Saeed" width=200></figure><p><strong>Aaqib Saeed</strong>, Eindhoven University of Technology
