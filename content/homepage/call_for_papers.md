We welcome submissions to two tracks:

- **Main Track (Original Research):** This track accepts original and unpublished work of 4 to 8-pages (excluding references). All submissions will undergo a double-blind review process, with three reviewers assigned to each paper. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, and presented as posters or oral presentations.

- **Non-Archival Track (Published Work):** Authors of papers previously published in other conferences or journals are invited to submit a 1-page summary to present their work, which will not be included in the proceedings. These submissions will be evaluated and selected by the organizers based on quality and relevance to the workshop topics.


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Machine Learning and computational models for movement and physiological wearables
- Resource efficient and lightweight models
- Multimodal fusion and synchronization strategies
- Methods for irregularly sampled or missing data
- Individual differences, personalization and context-awareness
- Ethical and privacy-preserving AI in wearable systems
- Novel wearables and applications
- Experimental methods for validation of wearable systems
- Lab-controlled experiments and In-the-wild deployment
- Datasets and Benchmarks
- Responsible data management and user consent
- Applications in Affective Computing / Mobile Health / Action Recognition / Social Interaction / HRI
