**Aaqib Saeed**, Eindhoven University of Technology
(TU/e), the Netherlands, is an Assistant Professor
(tenured) at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).
He holds a Ph.D. cum laude from TU/e, where he
conducted research in the Department of Mathematics
and Computer Science, on self-supervised learning for
8
sensory data (ECG, EEG, IMU, PPG and Audio). Aaqib Saeed studies Artificial
Intelligence at the intersection of Self-Supervised Learning, Sensing Systems,
and Decentralized Computing. His work explores intelligent systems that can
learn from raw sensory signals (ECG, EEG, Audio, Speech, IMU) without
extensive human supervision, enabling scalable AI solutions for healthcare and
beyond.
